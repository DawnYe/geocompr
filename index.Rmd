# Welcome {-}

Welcome to **geocompr**, the [website](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr) of our forthcoming book with [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER).

## Development {-}

Inspired by the **bookdown** [R package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) we are developing this book in the open.
We decided to make the book open source.
Why?
To encourage contributions, ensure reproducibility and provide access to the material as it evolves.

We're developing the book in four main phases.
We're in phase two and focused on the application chapters, which we aim to be complete by December.
Drafts of other chapters will be added to this website as the project progresses.

1. Foundations
2. Basic applications
3. Geocomputation methods
4. Advanced applications

Currently we're working primarily on the second part, which we aim to be complete by December.
New chapters will be added to this website as the project progresses, hosted at [robinlovelace.net/geocompr](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr) and kept up-to-date thanks to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr).
Currently the build is:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr) 

The version of the book you are reading now was built on `r Sys.Date()` and was built `r if(is_on_travis) "on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr)" else "locally"`.
**bookdown** makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki, provided you have a GitHub account ([sign-up at github.com](https://github.com/)).
Once logged-in to GitHub, clicking on the 'edit me' icon highlighted in the image below will take you to the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) where you can make changes:

To raise an issue about the book's content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues).

## Reproducibility {-}

To reproduce the book, you need a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and up-to-date packages.
The following code should install the required packages:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=is_online}
if(!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/geocompr")
```

To build the book locally, clone or [download](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/archive/master.zip) the [geocompr repo](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/), open the [geocompr.Rproj project file](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/geocompr.Rproj) in RStudio and run the following lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build the book
browseURL("_book/index.html") # to view it
```

# Preface

This book is aimed at people who are interest in doing spatial data analysis with R, including:

- Graduate students and researchers from geography, remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems, Geographic Data Science and related fields (GIS/GIScience/GDS)
- Academic researchers and post-graduate students in specific fields such as remote sensing, biogeosciences, ecology, forestry, transportation, and broadly defined 'data science' who would like to harness the power and flexibility of R for their work <!-- please add further fields-->
- Applied researchers and analysts in public, private or third-sector organisations who need the reproducibility, speed and flexibility of a command-line language such as R in applications dealing with spatial data as divers as urban planning, transportation (including personal travel and logistics) and geo-marketing <!-- please add further examples-->

This book will also be of use to people with a solid knowledge of GIS who enhance their skills with command-line methods, to enable automation and reproducibility in geographic data workflows.

We have taken care to make the contents as accessible as possible to a wide audience: the difficulty level of the chapters progresses gradually and exercises are provided at the end of each chapter to ensure understanding.
However, R novices may find the reproducible code chunks --- an integral part of the book --- difficult to understand and implement on first reading. 
People who have only used graphical user interface (GUI) based GIS software such as QGIS and ArcMap may find the focus on the code unnatural to begin with.
However we are confident that, with practice, the command-line approach demonstrated in this book will become intuitive and, for many applications, faster than the point-and-click alternatives provided by mainstream desktop programs.
For some applications such as Bayesian Spatial Statistics and applications where processes must be automated the command-line approach may be essential for getting the work done.

As outlined in section \@ref(why-geocomputation-with-r) there are many reasons for using R for geocomputation.
Other languages can be used and for some applications Python, Java, C++ or something else may be more appropriate.
We advocate learning one language in *depth* to gain an understanding of the concepts, and to become proficient with one programming languages before dabbling with many, and R can solve the majority of day-to-day challenges that geocomputation skill can solve.
However, there are excellent resources for learning geocomputation in other languages and we recommend checking-out alternatives outlined in section \@ref(software-for-geocomputation) if your interest is in the wider field of command-line geocomputation.

<!-- to think about, not sure if needed but then this would be a good place to point out why our book might have advantages over other books. Compare with:
- Bivand, R., Pebesma, E., Gomez-Rubio, V. (2013): Applied spatial data analysis with R.
- Blangiardo, M. & Cameletti, M. (2015): Spatial and spatio-temporal Bayesian models with R - INLA.
- Brunsdon, C. & Comber, L. (2015): An introduction to R for spatial analysis and mapping.
- Dorman, M. (2014): Learning R for geospatial analysis.
- Hijmans, R. (2016): Spatial data analysis and modeling with R.  http://rspatial.org/intr/index.html (haven't read it but might be more suitable for beginners, however, it does not consider sf; additionally, it provides more code than text, and hence, probably less explanations than our book) 
- Quiang, S. (2016): Environmental and Ecological Statistics with R (not really a competitor, I have ordered a copy, this book is really about modeling, and I would rather prefer the Zuur et al. books over it)
- Wegmann, M., Leutner, B., Dech, S. (2016): Remote Sensing and GIS for ecologists: Using Open Source Software.
- Zuur, A., Ieno, E., Saveliev, A. (2017): Beginner's guide to spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal ecological data analysis with R-INLA.
