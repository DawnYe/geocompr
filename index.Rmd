# Welcome {-}

Welcome to **geocompr**, the [website](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr) of our forthcoming book with [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER).

## Development {-}

Inspired by the **bookdown** [R package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) we are developing this book in the open.
We decided to make the book open source.
Why?
To encourage contributions, ensure reproducibility and provide access to the material as it evolves.

We're developing the book in four main phases.
We're in phase two and focussed on the application chapters, which we aim to be complete by December.
Drafts of other chapters will be added to this website as the project progresses.

1. Foundations
2. Basic applications
3. Geocomputation methods
4. Advanced applications

Currently we're working primarily on the second part, which we aim to be complete by December.
New chapters will be added to this website as the project progresses, hosted at [robinlovelace.net/geocompr](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr) and kept up-to-date thanks to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr).
Currently the build is:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr) 

The version of the book you are reading now was built on `r Sys.Date()` and was built `r if(is_on_travis) "on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr)" else "locally"`.
**bookdown** makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki, provided you have a GitHub account ([sign-up at github.com](https://github.com/)).
Once logged-in to GitHub, clicking on the 'edit me' icon highlighted in the image below will take you to the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) where you can make changes:

To raise an issue about the book's content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues).

## Reproducibility {-}

To reproduce the book, you need a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and up-to-date packages.
The following code should install the required packages:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=is_online}
if(!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/geocompr")
```

To build the book locally, clone or [download](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/archive/master.zip) the [geocompr repo](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/), open the [geocompr.Rproj project file](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/geocompr.Rproj) in RStudio and run the following lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build the book
browseURL("_book/index.html") # to view it
```

For further details see the book's GitHub page at [Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr#geocomputation-with-r).
