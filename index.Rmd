# Welcome {-}

Welcome to **geocompr**, the [website](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr) of our forthcoming book with [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER).

## Development {-}

Inspired by the **bookdown** [R package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) we are developing this book in the open.
We decided to make the book open source.
Why?
To encourage contributions, ensure reproducibility and provide access to the material as it evolves.

We're developing the book in four main phases.
We're in phase two and focussed on the application chapters, which we aim to be complete by December.
Drafts of other chapters will be added to this website as the project progresses.

1. Foundations
2. Basic applications
3. Geocomputation methods
4. Advanced applications

Currently we're working primarily on the second part, which we aim to be complete by December.
New chapters will be added to this website as the project progresses, hosted at [robinlovelace.net/geocompr](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr) and kept up-to-date thanks to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr).
Currently the build is:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr) 

The version of the book you are reading now was built on `r Sys.Date()` and was built `r if(is_on_travis) "on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr)" else "locally"`.
**bookdown** makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki, provided you have a GitHub account ([sign-up at github.com](https://github.com/)).
Once logged-in to GitHub, clicking on the 'edit me' icon highlighted in the image below will take you to the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) where you can make changes:

To raise an issue about the book's content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues).

## Reproducibility {-}

To reproduce the book, you need a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and up-to-date packages.
The following code should install the required packages:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=is_online}
if(!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/geocompr")
```

To build the book locally, clone or [download](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/archive/master.zip) the [geocompr repo](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/), open the [geocompr.Rproj project file](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/geocompr.Rproj) in RStudio and run the following lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build the book
browseURL("_book/index.html") # to view it
```

For further details see the book's GitHub page at [Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr#geocomputation-with-r).

# Preface

This book is certainly aimed at people with an interest in spatial data analysis with the help of R.
This includes graduate students and researchers from geography, remote sensing and GIScience but also from other backgrounds as diverse as remote sensing, biogeosciences, ecology, forestry, transportation, ... <!-- please add further fields-->
This is the beauty of GIScience as it is applicable to all fields dealing with spatial phenomena.
And even more importantly, GIScience is not only a scientific domain but also used in the public sector and in the business world.
This makes our book, furthermore, interesting to people dealing with urban planning, transportation (logistics) and (geo-)marketing, ... <!-- please add further examples-->
This book also aims at persons with a solid knowledge of GIS technologies who wish to automate  their spatial data analysis workflow in a reproducible manner on the command line.

Though we have tried our best to make our book as accessible as possible to a wide audience, people new to R might find it hard at first reading. 
People who prefer a GUI-based GIS approach over the command line might find this book only interesting from a conceptual point of view. 
Our programming language is R, and though we refer at times to other languages, people with an interest in geoprocessing with Python, Java, C++ or alike should probably look for another book.

<!-- to think about, not sure if needed but then this would be a good place to point out why our book might have advantages over the other books --> 
compare with:
- ASDAR
- An intro to R for spatial analysis and mapping
- Remote Sensing and GIS for ecologists
- Mapping and Environmental and Ecological Statistics with R (not really a competitor, I have ordered a copy, this book is really about modeling, and I would rather prefer the Zuur et al. books over it)
- http://rspatial.org/intr/index.html (haven't read it but might be more suitable for beginners, however, it does not consider sf; additionally, it provides more code than text, and hence, probably less explanations than our book)
