# Preface

## Who this book is for and who is it not for

This book is certainly aimed at people with an interest in spatial data analysis with the help of R.
This includes graduate students and researchers from geography, remote sensing and GIScience but also from other backgrounds as diverse as remote sensing, biogeosciences, ecology, forestry, transportation, ... <!-- please add further fields-->
This is the beauty of GIScience as it is applicable to all fields dealing with spatial phenomena.
And even more importantly, GIScience is not only a scientific domain but also used in the public sector and in the business world.
This makes our book, furthermore, interesting to people dealing with urban planning, transportation (logistics) and (geo-)marketing, ... <!-- please add further examples-->
This book also aims at persons with a solid knowledge of GIS technologies who wish to automate  their spatial data analysis workflow in a reproducible manner on the command line.

Though we have tried our best to make our book as accessible as possible to a wide audience, people new to R might find it hard at first reading. 
People who prefer a GUI-based GIS approach over the command line might find this book only interesting from a conceptual point of view. 
Our programming language is R, and though we refer at times to other languages, people with an interest in geoprocessing with Python, Java, C++ or alike should probably look for another book.
