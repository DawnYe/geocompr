#### Spatial subsetting in base R

Another spatial subsetting example will use an object representing the countries of Africa, created using attribute subsetting as follows:^[Recall
attribute subsetting can also be done in base R with `africa_wgs = world[world$continent == "Africa", ]`.]

```{r}
africa_wgs = world %>% filter(continent == "Africa")
```

To further prepare the input data, we will reproject the data to the coordinate reference system (CRS) 32630, its EPSG code (explained in Chapter 6):

```{r}
africa = st_transform(africa_wgs, crs = 32630)
```

We can also use the `[` operator for *Spatial* subsetting.
The difference is that we use *another spatial object* inside the square brackets instead of an `integer` or `logical` vector.
This is a concise and consistent syntax, as shown in the next code chunk.
Let's test it with a hypothetical scenario: we want to subset all countries within 2000 km of the point where the equator (where latitude = 0 degrees) intersects the prime meridian (longitude = 0 degrees), as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:globe).
The subsetting object is created below.
Note that this must have the same CRS as the target object (set with the `crs` argument):

```{r, warning=FALSE}
center_wgs = st_sf(geometry = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 0)), crs = 4326))
center = st_transform(center_wgs, 32630)
buff = st_buffer(center, dist = 2e6)
```

```{r globe, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subsetting scenario: which countries intersect with a circle of 2000 km in radius located at zero degrees longitude and zero degrees latitude? Figure created with the **[globe](https://cran.r-project.org/package=globe)** package."}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/globe.png")
```

The data to be subset, or 'target layer', is the `africa` object created above, which has a projected CRS (`32630`).
Subsequently, spatial subsetting can be done with a single, concise command:

```{r}
africa_buf = africa[buff, ]
```

```{block2 type='rmdnote'}
If we were using geographic ('lon/lat') data the previous command would have emitted a message warning about assuming `planar coordinates`.
This is because spatial operations (especially distance and area calculations) cannot be assumed to be accurate in a geographic (longitude/latitude) CRS.
In this case one could justify the use of a lon/lat CRS: the data is close to the equator where there is least distortion caused by the curvature of the earth.
It is good practice to reproject spatial datasets before performing spatial operations on them.
```

The spatial subsetting clearly worked: only countries intersecting with the giant circle are returned (Figure \@ref(fig:africa-buff)):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(africa_buf["pop"])
plot(buff, add = TRUE)
```


Todo: improve this figure, e.g. by creating a new hidden chunk - still show this one
```{r africa-buff, fig.cap="Subset of the `africa` data selected based on their intersection with a circle 2000 km in radius with a center point at 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude.", echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("OpenMapSurfer.Grayscale") %>%
  addPolygons(data = st_transform(africa_buf, 4326)) %>%
  addPolygons(data = st_transform(buff, 4326), color = "red")
```

Note that countries that just touch the giant circle are selected such as Chad (northeast of the circle).
This is because the default subsetting operator is `st_intersects()`, which returns any type of spatial relation.
Other spatial subsetting operations such as `st_within()` are more conservative, as shown in section \@ref(topological-relations).
